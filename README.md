No Rest For Heroes - Game design tests quest for Solarus Engine

No Rest For Heroes is a quest for Solarus Engine (http://www.solarus-games.org/), it is NOT a real game, even if it is based on the Zelda Mystery of Solarus scripts ( https://github.com/christopho/zsdx/ ). The quest presents as a hub with several trials, you can choose to reset each trial when it is completed. Each trial is totaly independant and the equipment needed varies, when you enter the hub your character is reset with all his items, so each time you want to try a trial, you have to pass by the weaponry, which will equip you as needed for the trial.

This quest is free and licensed under CC-BY ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ ), meaning you can reuse, adapt, copy, change the maps and scripts, all I  want is being mentioned (nickname or realname) somewhere (in your code, in your credits, don't mind). If you want to send a little email to tell me that you're using my work, it will be a pleasure to look at your project or to help to adapt the code to your specifics needs.

Of course, all non-code (graphisms, musics, etc) are licenced by their originals authors (Nintendo, Squaresoft/Square-enix...), so if you know a graphist or you are one and you want to help the Engine to have more free graphics, please check the project Children of Solarus ( https://github.com/Bertram25/ChildenOfSolarus ), where they try to change all graphisms of Zelda Mystery of Solarus (DX and XD) into free graphisms. When this project will be done, No Rest For Heroes will use them.


How to install it
-----------------

You just have to clone the repo and install or compile the solarus engine. Currently, the quest needs the development version of the Engine, Solarus 1.2. That's because it will need some features for some enigma. So you can't install the Engine and you have to compile it. You can find the howto here : http://www.solarus-games.org/solarus/compilation-instructions/ . Once done, you just have to execute the file with the path of the folder containing data folder of the repo. And enjoy :)
